These tutorials are a good start, but you'll want to get your hands dirty on some \"real-world\" datasets. You probably also want to check out some other learning materials. Fortunately, there are a lot of them out there.\n",

Good places to start are [MLData](http://mldata.org/) or [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com). Alternatively, you can always ask around the twitterverse as people tend to be pretty helpful.\n",
