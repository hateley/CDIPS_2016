# A short tutorial on Natural Language Processing
**This tutorial on basic NLP techniques for data science was created for the UC Berkeley CDIPS 2016 workshop. Most parts were taken from the kaggle [Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).**



## Introduction
_What is NLP?_
NLP (Natural Language Processing) is a set of techniques for approaching text problems. This tutorial will run you through basic NLP techniques. Please see parts 2 and 3 on the kaggle website for more advnaced tutorials. A brief intro can be found in this repo's NLP_presentation.pdf


## Interactive Tutorial
We'll use an ipython notebook to run through kaggle's excellent intro on NLP. Use the notebook included in this repo, entitled "Bag_of_words"
Follow the tutorial [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words)
This will help you get started with loading and cleaning the IMDB movie reviews. If you like you can then follow up iwth applying a simple Bag of Words model to get surprisingly accurate predictions of whether a review is thumbs-up or thumbs-down.
